	<h1>Hi there! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Austin.</h1>
	<p>I am a developer currently focused on full-stack web development. I enjoy reading, coding, and hikingâ€”or really anything outdoors. But my favorite thing by far is problem-solving and learning new things along the way.</p>
	<p>This site is a work in progress but you can find my GitHub <a href="https://github.com/austinthornley" target=_blank>here</a>.</p>
